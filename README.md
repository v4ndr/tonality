# TONALITY

Tonality is a tool for worship band musicians.

It synthesizes in a pocket format, the songs most sung in churches transcribed in "degrees".

The numbers system, based on degrees, allows a simplified reading, a rapid transposition of chord grids.

The transcription of the songs is in progress.
